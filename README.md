# flappyBird-Tutorial
This project is a youtube tutorial I followed to create a flappyBird game program. 2nd project after Hello World.
This project was halted after I realized that I wouldn't be able to follow certain steps such as adding colors
because I would need libraries to utilize for pulling certain things. I realized that I would need  to start 
a more simple project and get a foundation before I started making games.
